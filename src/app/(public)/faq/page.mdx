# Frequently asked questions

## Who is HENRYS for?

HENRYS is for wildly interesting singles aged 25–38 who are over the scroll and craving intentional IRL experiences. We curate a balanced membership across industries, backgrounds, and energies to keep every table dynamic.

## How do applications work?

Apply once. The founders review every response. If we sense a fit, we&apos;ll invite you to a short video chat or martini walk to align on vibe and expectations. Approved members receive a one-click invite to finish onboarding—no endless waitlists.

## What kinds of events can I expect?

Think chef&apos;s tables, speakeasy takeovers, gallery nights, countryside escapes, and slow-sipping cocktail hours. We design for depth over volume and cap most gatherings at 24 guests so the conversation stays electric.

## Do you use algorithms to match members?

We default to human-led matching. Feature flags like `ALGO_MATCHING` let us experiment with lightweight recommendation tools, but the founding team always has the final say on seating and intros.

## Is my data safe?

Yes. We only collect what&apos;s needed to seat you well: preferences, vibe, and availability. Everything lives in an encrypted database. We never sell or share your data, and you can request deletion anytime.

## How much does membership cost?

Annual membership and event pricing varies by season. Expect a monthly membership option plus à-la-carte event tickets via Stripe. Scholarships are available—just mention it in your application.

## Can I bring a plus one?

Members can request a plus-one for select salons. Hosts review every guest to keep the mix aligned. Invites, digital tickets, and check-in happen through your dashboard and the host tools.

## What if I need to cancel?

Life happens. Members can cancel RSVPs directly from the dashboard up to 48 hours before an event. For last-minute changes, ping your host so we can offer the seat to someone on the waitlist.

## Are hosts trained?

Yes. Hosts access run-of-show docs, real-time rosters, and QR check-in tools in the host portal. We invest in hospitality training and have a rotating bench of alumni hosts for larger events.
