# Why HENRYS exists

Dating apps created infinite choice and zero texture. HENRYS is our antidote: an invite-only club for wildly interesting humans who would rather make eye contact than swipe.

## Our rituals

- **Founder review** — every application is read by the founding team (no outsourcing).
- **Slow curation** — we balance age, industries, and energy levels across each cohort.
- **Hospitality-first** — hosts receive detailed run-of-show guides, guest notes, and welcome rituals for every gathering.
- **Privacy by design** — no public member directory, no cameras without consent, and no third-party data sharing.

## Membership perks

- Members-only dashboard with RSVPs, receipts, and invite codes.
- Access to weekly salons, supper clubs, adventure days, and seasonal retreats.
- Concierge intros to aligned members and founders when you travel.
- Ability to pause or gift membership when life pivots.

## The team

HENRYS was co-founded by Kayla & Sophie—hospitality nerds, community builders, and relentless romantics. They partner with a rotating crew of hosts, sommeliers, and cultural curators to keep the calendar fresh.
