      HENRYS brings together curious and generous people. This Code of Conduct protects the wellbeing of our community
      and ensures every experience remains respectful, inclusive, and memorable. These expectations apply to every
      guest, member, host, partner, and team member participating in HENRYS spaces—whether physical or digital.

  <section id="purpose">
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      This policy outlines how we protect the dignity and safety of our community. Everyone shares responsibility for
      upholding these standards and supporting the people around them. If you see something that puts a guest at risk,
      step in safely or alert a host immediately.
    </p>

  <section id="community-values">
    <h2>Community values</h2>
    <p>We expect every interaction to embody the following principles:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Curiosity.</strong> Listen generously, ask thoughtful questions, and leave space for perspectives different from your own.</li>
      <li><strong>Respect.</strong> Celebrate identities, pronouns, and boundaries. Consent is required for physical contact, photography, and sharing stories.</li>
      <li><strong>Confidentiality.</strong> Treat conversations and personal details shared at HENRYS as private unless everyone involved agrees otherwise.</li>
      <li><strong>Care.</strong> Prioritise the comfort and safety of others, including honouring dietary requirements and accessibility needs.</li>
    </ul>

      <li>Be mindful of alcohol consumption and ensure any guests you bring do the same.</li>
      <li>Seek explicit consent before initiating romantic, physical, or intrusive conversations.</li>
      <li>Report safety concerns, harassment, or suspicious behaviour to a host straight away.</li>

  <section id="reporting-concerns">
    <h2>Reporting concerns</h2>
    <p>
      If you experience or witness behaviour that breaches this Code, please tell a host immediately or email
      <a href="mailto:hello@henrys.house"> hello@henrys.house</a>. Reports may be submitted anonymously, and we will
      respect confidentiality wherever possible while ensuring the safety of the community.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="consequences">
    <h2>Consequences</h2>
    <p>
      We investigate every report promptly. Actions can include verbal warnings, removal from an event without refund,
      revocation of membership, or notifying law enforcement where legally required. Decisions are based on the
      severity of the incident and any prior conduct.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="updates">
    <h2>Updates</h2>
    <p>
      We may revise this Code to reflect our evolving community. Continued participation in HENRYS experiences after
      updates are published means you agree to the latest version. Significant changes will be communicated directly to
      members and regular guests.
