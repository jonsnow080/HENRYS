    <h2>Information we collect</h2>
    <p>We collect personal information in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Information you provide directly.</strong> When you apply, RSVP, register interest, or communicate with us, we

      <li>
        <strong>Payment data.</strong> If you purchase tickets or memberships through our partners (including Stripe), relevant

        manage your membership.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Automatically collected data.</strong> When you visit our digital products we collect log data, device
        identifiers, and usage analytics to improve performance and security.
